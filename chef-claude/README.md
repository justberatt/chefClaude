# Chef Claude

1. The first interactive React App in the course (@Scrimba, React Basics, Section 3).
It is a recipes app. One that will generate a recipe with the user-given ingredients.

2. In the input field you will write an ingredient and then press the '+ Add ingredient' button. As soon as you click the button, the ingredient will show up on the UI and a 'get recipe' button will be added to the page. You can continue adding ingredients until you are happy with what you want, and then you can press the 'get recipe' button.

3. Finally, after clicking the 'get recipe' button, the app will return a recipe along with the instructions on how to prepare it.
